## Task Description: 
   This task was created by Mary to help scholars of the Google Africa Developer Scholarship 2021 
   further hone their basic skill of web styling and accessibility of responsive webpages.

   Upon completion of the task i can say i have gotten better at creating responsive websites while keeping 
   accessibility in mind.

   "There is no perfect code", feel free to reachout with comments and contributions, i will really love that.


## Requirements:
   Use html and pure css (not bootstrap or any other library or framework)
    
   Make sure the input fields, links and buttons are accessible via keyboard (i.e. focus
   should appear around input fields, links and buttons when you navigate the  page
   using tab key on your computer keyboard)
    
   Fix this: In the original pluralsight page, focus moves from the "create an account"
   button to "terms of use" link. It skips the tiny help button in the bottom left of
   the page. Make the focus appear on elements in the order that they appear on the page.

   Must be responsive (exactly as it is on the original pluralsight login page).
